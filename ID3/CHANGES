v1.0
----

21 September 2000: First 1.0 release. Add ID3 v1.1 support (the last
byte of the Comments field is considered to be a track number if the
previous byte is non-null).

Add whitespace/null stripping to the end of all fields. If this breaks
anything, please let me know! I shouldn't assume this, but I figure
it'd be nice for folks not to have to do this on their own. I'll take
it out if it causes problems.

Write a README, COPYING, CHANGES file, and add a setup.py for
Distutils and Python 1.6 users.

v0.6
----

11 June 1999: Fix from Arne Zellentin (arne@unix-ag.org) to prevent
wiping out the last 128 bytes of MP3 files that don't already have an
ID3 tag. Oops!

2 May 1999: Initial release.
